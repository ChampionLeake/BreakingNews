/* A "New York Times Crossword" NDS stack smash exploit */

Savefile is approximently 0x1FFF(8 KB) bytes long. This game has 4 saveslots, you can easily overwrite any of them to stack on additional code

Vulnerability: Stack Smash Buffer Overflow via Player Name
The player name has a limit of 15 character strings to create the save-slot. The string length/size is not checked so using a long extensive string, one can overwrite several stack registers and take control of the Point Counter(0x1A7 bytes) and using it to jump to your unsigned code from the stack. 

Payload Address: 0xb9e84 + 0x02000000 = 0x020b9e84 (84 9e 0b 02)
Payload Offset: 0x1900
Jump Offset(in the savefile): 0x20

-Ttext=0x0x20B85B4 used in the 'Makefile' to be able to access memory relative to where the payload is loaded.
